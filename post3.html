              A video of former cricketer and BJP MP Gautam Gambhir showing his
              middle finger toward a crowd in the stands during a game at the
              Asia Cup 2023 with chants of "Bharat tere tukde honge" (India will
              break) heard in the background is doctored. BOOM found that the
              audio in the video has been overlaid and has been taken from a
              2016 news report. On September 4, 2023, a video of Gautam Gambhir
              reacting to a crowd that can be heard chanting "Kohli Kohli" by
              showing them his middle finger went viral on social media. Gambhir
              later reacted to the video of him making the explicit gesture
              claiming that the crowd comprised of Pakistani cricket fans who
              were allegedly chanting "Hindustan murdabad" and anti-India
              slogans. However, in the video that went viral, these slogans
              cannot be heard. The Indian cricket team faced Pakistan in their
              opening Asia Cup 2023 ODI match on September 2, 2023, at the
              Pallekele International Stadium in Sri Lanka. Gambhir is a
              commentator at the Asia Cup and was commentating during the India
              vs. Pakistan game and the recent India vs. Nepal game. Gambhir and
              Virat Kohli had an on-field argument during the Lucknow Super
              Giants (LSG) and Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) during this
              year's Indian Premier League (IPL). In the five seconds video that
              is being shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), "Bharat tere
              tukde honge" chant can be heard. The video has the watermark
              (@xTripti). The video was tweeted by the X handle Riya Agrahari
              (@Riyaagrahari8) with the caption, "You can't expect better from
              Pakistan. The whole country is gutter. I stand with
              #GautamGambhir"
